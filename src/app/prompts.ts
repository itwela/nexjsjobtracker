const bulletGuideLines = 
`
Clearly indicate internships are internships and contract positions are contract positions
Order positions and bullet points by relevancy to the job in OR impressiveness: put the best stuff first!
Add context. Simply listing positions/projects and adding industry buzzwords is not enough. You need to tell hiring managers what you did and how you solved problems.
Differentiate yourself and don't be humble. Simply listing job duties will not make your resume any different from others: your resume is not your job description.. Tell us about your accomplishments, tangible metrics, and technical victories.
Avoid centering your skills around a piece of software if you can. Any idiot can learn how to sketch, extrude, cut, and mate in SolidWorks - but identifying capabilities gaps (a need), creating a preliminary design, and taking it through the rest of the design process is something that fewer people can do, so try to focus on the engineering skills behind it. CAD and other software should be an “oh by the way” if possible.
Use bullet points, not paragraphs
If you're just graduating, focus more on showing a mastery of fundamental engineering skills first, then worry about the project management/leadership stuff if there is room left.

Not only are management & leadership very different in the real world, but no department in their right mind will have a new grad run a department or project or anything more complex than picking up lunch for the team. They are looking for someone who can master basic engineering tasks in this specific discipline and can hold a basic conversation. Show them you can do that first, and then think about running the show down the line.

Bullet Points:
Objectives
Highlight the technical work you did
Highlight technical challenges you faced and overcame
Highlight the impact of your work

General Rules:
Bullet points should be 1-2 lines long.
Aim for 1 sentence per bullet
Bullet points should be ordered from most relevant/impressive to least, as some hiring managers only have time to read the first they should get THE BEST!
Don't use personal pronouns i.e. I, we, us, my, our, their
Don't end bullet points with periods. Bullet points != sentences
Avoid the excess use of sub-bullet points, they can clutter your resume, making it more verbose and harder to read.
Avoid using apostrophes ', ampersands &, and slashes /
Avoid the excessive use of adjectives and adverbs, they're superfluous
Use digits instead of spelling out numbers: 8 eight

Action Verbs:
Each bullet should begin with a strong, past-tense action verb.
Led is the past tense of lead
Good examples: analyzed, architected, automated, built, created, decreased, designed, developed, implemented, improved, optimized, published, reduced, refactored
Bad examples:
aided, assisted, coded, collaborated, communicated, executed, exposed to, gained experience, helped, participated, programmed, ran, used, utilized, worked on

Don't use the verb utilize. 9/10 times that word will be attached to some disgusting Gordian knot of a sentence that says in 20 words what could be said in 10.
superfluous/awkward/unnecessarily complex verbs: amplified, conceptualized, crafted, elevated, employed, engaged, engineered, enhanced, ensured, fostered, headed, honed, innovated, mastered, orchestrated, perfected, pioneered, revolutionized, spearheaded, transformed
frequently misused verbs: leverage, enhance, utilize
Each bullet point should follow STAR, XYZ, or CAR

STAR stands for Situation, Task,  Action, and Result.
A STAR method resume contains work experience bullet points that answer the following questions:
Situation: What situation or challenge did you face?
Task: What task were you involved in? What were your responsibilities and goals?
Action: What actions did you specifically take to achieve the task? How did you contribute to your team’s efforts?
Result: What was the outcome of your actions? How did it benefit your company? Can it be quantified?

XYZ: Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]

CAR: Challenge Action Result

Sample Bullet Points:

- Developed a back-end web service to handle user authentication using JWT and interacting with existing user services to store session data in Redis cache, leading to a 14% reduction in dropped session complaints
- Led the development of a data pipeline platform using Kafka streams, ingesting data from various data stores from across the application, resulting in a more streamlined developer experience for data query teams and reduced congestion by 24% during peak hours
- Developed a React Native-based mobile application by collaborating with product design teams, interacting with a GraphQL API allowing users to navigate and make orders to local restaurants
- Constructed and optimized distributed data scraping and processing pipelines leveraging Flume in Python and C++ to create labeled image datasets used for model training and evaluation
- Wrote backend video processing (C++) and video playback rendering code (Java, JavaScript) to support optimized video encoding/decoding which varied depending on operating system and platform and allowed for significant savings in video start latency and size

If you're able to quantify your achievements/results, move the metrics towards the start of each bullet.
